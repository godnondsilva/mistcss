## Usage

MistCSS is better understood with an example.

Let's create a classic `Button` component accepting two props:

- `size: 'lg' | 'sm'`
- `danger: boolean`

`src/Button.mist.css`

::: code-group

```css [CSS]
@scope (.button) {
  button:scope {
    /* Default style */
    font-size: 1rem;
    border-radius: 0.25rem;

    &[data-size='lg'] {
      font-size: 1.5rem;
    }

    &[data-size='sm'] {
      font-size: 0.75rem;
    }

    &[data-danger] {
      background-color: red;
      color: white;
    }
  }
}
```

```css [CSS + Tailwind]
@scope (.button) {
  button:scope {
    /* Default style */
    @apply text-base rounded-sm;

    &[data-size='lg'] {
      @apply text-lg;
    }

    &[data-size='sm'] {
      @apply text-sm;
    }

    &[data-danger] {
      @apply bg-red-700 text-white;
    }
  }
}
```

:::

::: warning
The class in `@scope` needs to be unique across your project. Plans are in place to automate this check.
:::

::: info
💯 of the CSS code above is standard and valid. MistCSS doesn't introduce any proprietary syntax. As a consequence, your code editor will support it out of the box.
:::

Run `mistcss` command:

```shell
npx mistcss ./src
# Button.mist.tsx will be created
```

You can now import your `Button` component like this:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```tsx
import { Button } from '.components/Button.mist'

export default const App = () => (
  <main>
    {/* Use it like a normal React component */}
    <Button size="lg">Submit</Button>
    <Button size="lg" danger>Delete</Button>
    <Button onClick={handleClick}>Cancel</Button>

    {/* 💥 TypeScript will catch the wrong size here */}
    <Button size="foo">Oops</Button>
  </main>
)
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

And just like that a visual and type safe React component was created without writing a single line of JS ✨

## The power of CSS

Since MistCSS uses pure CSS, you're not limited and can use **ALL** CSS features directly:

- Container queries `@container` to adapt style based on your component size
- CSS variables, for example `--primary-color`, to have a consistent style
- Media queries `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`, to handle dark mode
- And more...

Of course, you can also use TailwindCSS utility classes in your MistCSS components (click on the `CSS + Tailwind` in the Button example above).

## Support

MistCSS is a new project, expect **breaking changes** until `v1.0`.
